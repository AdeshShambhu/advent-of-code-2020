# advent-of-code-2020
[Advent of Code ](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language. This is an yearly event and a new coding puzzle is released everyday from Dec 1 until Dec 25.

This repository consists of my solutions to the 2020's version of Advent of Code. All my solutions are written in Java. 

The solutions are organised inside Java packages from day 1 - day N inside `src/main/java/com/advent` and the inputs are stored in the corresponding files inside `src/main/java/resources/input/` and are formatted in Day\<advent-day-number\>\<puzzle-name\>.txt.
